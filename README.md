The project is a simple (at least for now) app to create lists of medications (or anything else) to use.

Built with `React`, `Redux Toolkit`, `React Final Forms` and `Material UI`.

Tests are written with `Jest` and `React Testing Library`.

The app offers functionality to create mentioned above simple lists of medications with its quantity and time of intake.

The Dark Mode is available.

Further development is coming soon!
