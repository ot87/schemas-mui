This project is a simple (at least for now) app to create lists of medications (or anything else) to use built with help of React, Redux, React Final Forms and Material UI.

Its draft name is Schemas.

The app offers functionality to create mentioned above simple lists of medications with its quantity and time of intake.

Further development is coming soon!
